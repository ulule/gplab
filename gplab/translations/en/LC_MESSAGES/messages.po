"<h2>GAMESPLANET <span class=\"lab\">LAB</span> CHARTER</h2>        <h3>10"
" COMMITMENTS FOR QUALITY CROWDFUNDING FOR VIDEO GAMES</h3>        "
"<h4>Preamble</h4>        <p>The video game digital distribution sector – "
"and in particular video game crowdfunding – is faced with an increasing "
"number of calls for projects, as well as the demanding requirements of "
"backers who need to be reassured about the reliability of presented "
"projects and the quality of games they back financially.</p>        "
"<p>Gamesplanet has decided to provide services for crowdfunding of "
"quality video games, by raising awareness of the actors in the sector so "
"that they, in turn, commit to guaranteeing the satisfaction of "
"gamers.</p>        <p>Gamesplanet Lab is the first crowdfunding platform "
"exclusively dedicated to video games and designed by video game "
"professionals (and fans!), to integrate real guarantees for gamers, as "
"well as a straightforward and beneficial framework for video game "
"professionals. The platform is created in partnership with Ulule.com, the"
" leader in crowdfunding in Europe.</p>        <p><strong>The Gamesplanet "
"Lab charter comprises 10 commitments</strong>, and aims at catering to "
"the requirements and expectations of backers and gamers alike. Beyond "
"providing guarantees for gamers, the charter is designed for video game "
"professionals and service providers who endeavor to provide quality "
"services, through ownership of a label or initiation of a quality "
"process.</p>        <h4>OUR 10 COMMITMENTS</h4>        <dl>            "
"<dt>Clear information</dt>                <dd>All project-related "
"information to backers should be clear, precise and up-to-date.</dd>"
"            <dt>Project holder identity</dt>                <dd>The "
"identity of a project holder is public, and their contact details always "
"available on their profile page.</dd>            <dt>Real selection "
"work</dt>                <dd>With Gamesplanet Lab every project is "
"handpicked. This, combined with the contractual link with project "
"holders, allows for the best project quality and chances for "
"success.</dd>            <dt>Virtuous funding solutions</dt>"
"                <dd>If a project does not reach its funding goals, or if "
"a project holder discontinues an ongoing project, all backers will "
"receive an email to inform them the project has been discontinued or has "
"not reached the full pledged amount (with detailed explanations in case "
"of discontinuation). All backers will receive a refund of their "
"contribution and neither the project holder nor Gamesplanet Lab shall "
"receive any money for that specific project.</dd>            <dt>A "
"guarantee for the delivery of rewards</dt>                <dd>All project"
" holders on Gamesplanet Lab commit by contract to design a game whose "
"feasibility will have previously been assessed by both parties. All "
"rewards must bring backers exclusive advantages over purchasers of the "
"distributed game in its final version (rewards are offered in limited "
"editions, are unique to backers, or the game is offered at a lower price "
"than the final retail price). Finally, backers are involved in the "
"creative process of the game and receive project news regularly, have the"
" possibility of submitting ideas or content, and may vote for any "
"suggestion put forward by the project holder.</dd>            <dt>A clear"
" timetable</dt>                <dd>The timetable must mention a delivery "
"date, at least estimated, for the rewards. In the event of a late "
"delivery, the project holder commits to informing backers as soon as "
"possible of the new delivery date.</dd>            <dt>Respect of "
"intellectual property rights</dt>                <dd>Tamounts paid out "
"may in no circumstances be regarded as transfer of shares, nor as "
"copyright assignment. The project holder retains full intellectual "
"property of his project.</dd>            <dt>Secure payments</dt>"
"                <dd>Gamesplanet Lab and Ulule.com both use payment "
"systems that conform to applicable banking standards: all transactions "
"are fully secured and Gamesplanet Lab does not keep any banking details "
"which could be hacked.</dd>            <dt>DRM: the gamer’s experience "
"before all</dt>                <dd>Project holders commit to integrating "
"to their final game, on delivery to backers, a DRM (Digital Rights "
"Management) system that prioritizes customer experience (possibility of "
"installing their games on all of their machines) rather than systematic "
"control, and the guarantee that no resident clients will be used for "
"marketing purposes.</dd>            <dt>A quality label designed with "
"gamers</dt>                <dd>The project holder commits to respecting "
"positive values within the games, and backers are invited to validate "
"quality criteria: each completed project is presented to a panel of "
"gamers comprised of project backers who hold the responsibility of "
"grading the project for quality, resulting in the issuance or not of a "
"specific Gamesplanet Lab label. This label, designed to reward project "
"holders with a minimum of 70%% backer approval for quality of the game "
"delivered, will be an indicator of gamer satisfaction for consumers and "
"will result in better promotion of the game within the distribution "
"network.</dd>        </dl>        <p>All project holders, publishers or "
"studios who are part of Gamesplanet Lab have subscribed to the "

"<h2>Gamesplanet <span class=\"lab\">Lab</span> FAQ</h2>        <dl>"
"            <dt>Why is Gamesplanet getting into video games "
"crowdfunding?</dt>                <dd>Gamesplanet already distributes "
"pre-order games upon request from publishers, so it’s only a matter of "
"positioning Gamesplanet a bit higher up in the distribution chain and "
"getting rid of the constraints of offering the same product as everyone "
"else, always at the same time, price point and margins as "
"competitors.<br/>                Gamesplanet is a video games downloading"
" distributor. It is in its digital distributor’s DNA to widen its offer "
"through selected projects that, available through pre-sale, will become "
"independent quality games, which could potentially be distributed "
"everywhere.<br/>                With crowdfunding, Gamesplanet wants to "
"submit selected projects to clients early on and give a chance to games "
"that may not have made it on the market due to the lack of support from "
"the traditional funding industry (or that would have made it out in a "
"different form as a result of compromises between resources and market "
"imperatives.) The goal is for those selected to make better games, away "
"from the constraints imposed by financial considerations and strengthened"
" by backers’ feedback.<br/>                With crowdfunding, Gamesplanet"
" wants to offer backers new rewards compared to video games distributed "
"traditionally: 1) follow up and as much participation of players in the "
"creative process as possible for an unprecedented relationship between "
"the player and the development studio; 2) access for game support during "
"its publication but also access to a whole new series of rewards, "
"especially artistic ones, closely linked to the creative process "
"(artwork, drawings, pencil originals, unique pieces, private meetings "
"with creators,…)<br/>                With crowdfunding, Gamesplanet wants"
" to guarantee the use of Digital Rights Management which will give "
"priority to the client’s experience (being able to install games on all "
"devices) instead of systematic policing; it also wants to guarantee that "
"a resident client won’t be used for purely marketing purposes.<br/>"
"                With crowdfunding, Gamesplanet wants to guarantee as much"
" as possible the quality of games offered to backers, to commit to "
"publication dates and push positive values in games. This is possible "
"since Metaboli is committed to a rigorous selection of projects (through "
"an ad hoc selection committee,) to quality control upon delivery (through"
" a panel of backer gamers who grade the product) and to contractual "
"relations with each project before its presentation to backers(the "
"project creator doesn’t just commit to the crowfunding platform’s General"
" Terms of Sale, he also signs a contract with Metaboli).<br/>"
"                With crowdfunding, Gamesplanet wants to guarantee that "
"authors will be paid and that they’ll be able to continue creating inside"
" a virtuous circle.<br/>                To formalize these commitments, "
"shared by project creators through a contract, Metaboli is setting up a "
"specific « Gamesplanet Lab » label that you can find here.</dd>"
"            <dt>What kind of innovation does Gamesplanet bring to the "
"video games crowdfunding sector?</dt>                <dd>100%% focus on "
"video games to avoid discussing projects that are out of our area of "
"expertise, a pre-evaluation of all projects to avoid presenting backers "
"multiple projects of very different quality, a guarantee of "
"professionalism by reminding project creators of how important it is not "
"to disappoint their backers. See our Chart here.<dd>            <dt>Why "
"has Gamesplanet teamed up with Ulule.com?</dt>                <dd>Ulule "
"is a major player in crowdfunding: it is the leading platform in Europe "
"with more than 800 projects funded, the first multilingual platform "
"(French, English, Italian, German, Spanish, Portuguese,) and it fits "
"perfectly with our idea of tomorrow’s digital distribution through "
"funding based on a number of products available for pre-sale. Add to that"
" a strong technological platform, 100%% safe payments, a successful "
"interface and you see why we chose Ulule to help develop Gamesplanet "
"Lab!</dd>            <dt>How are the projects available on Gamesplanet "
"Lab selected?</dt>                <dd>We talk a lot with each other, we "
"discuss ideas with developers, we look at what they’ve done in the past, "
"how and why, we think together about what we can and want to do with it, "
"about what type of games we would like to play… We make sure that "
"everyone has compatible intentions, we put it all together and we shake "
"it up!<br/>                When we like the result, we believe it makes "
"sense to present it to you, so we sign and we fully commit to making the "
"project happen!</dd>            <dt>How do you submit a project?</dt>"
